# Reverse Engineering

**Purpose**: Analyze existing codebase and generate comprehensive design artifacts

**Execute when**: Brownfield project detected (existing code found in workspace)

**Skip when**: Greenfield project (no existing code)

**Rerun behavior**: Always rerun when brownfield project detected, even if artifacts exist. This ensures artifacts reflect current code state

## Agent Delegation Strategy

**MANDATORY**: Delegate codebase analysis to specialized agents. Do NOT analyze the codebase directly.

**Execution mode**: Foreground parallel — launch multiple agents in the same response, but do NOT use `run_in_background: true`. This ensures:
- The user can see what each agent is doing
- Failed tasks are detected immediately (not silently lost)
- Results are available inline without polling via TaskOutput

**Recommended split**:
- **Agent 1** (`explore-medium`): Static code model — modules, data models, dependencies, file inventory, technology stack
- **Agent 2** (`explore-medium`): Dynamic behavior model — user flows, auth patterns, state management, API interactions, error handling

**If an agent task fails**: Follow the Agent Task Failure Recovery procedure in `error-handling.md` — retry the delegation, never silently do the work yourself.

**After both agents complete**: Compile their findings into the artifact files defined in the steps below.

## Step 1: Multi-Package Discovery

### 1.1 Scan Workspace
- All packages (not just mentioned ones)
- Package relationships via config files
- Package types: Application, CDK/Infrastructure, Models, Clients, Tests

### 1.2 Understand the Business Context
- The core business that the system is implementing overall
- The business overview of every package
- List of Business Transactions that are implemented in the system

### 1.3 Infrastructure Discovery
- CDK packages (package.json with CDK dependencies)
- Terraform (.tf files)
- CloudFormation (.yaml/.json templates)
- Deployment scripts

### 1.4 Build System Discovery

```

## Step 10: MANDATORY: Update State Tracking

**MANDATORY**: Update BOTH state files in the SAME interaction:
1. Update `aidlc-docs/{workflow-id}/aidlc-state.md`:

```markdown
## Reverse Engineering Status
- [x] Reverse Engineering - Completed on [timestamp]
- **Artifacts Location**: aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/
```

2. Update `aidlc-docs/{workflow-id}/checkpoint.json` — set reverse-engineering status to "completed" with completed_at timestamp, update current_inception_stage to next stage
- **Do NOT proceed to the next stage without completing this step**

## Step 11: Present Completion Message to User

```markdown
# 🔍 Reverse Engineering Complete

[AI-generated summary of key findings from analysis in the form of bullet points]

> **📋 <u>**REVIEW REQUIRED:**</u>**  
> Please examine the reverse engineering artifacts at: `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/`

> **🚀 <u>**WHAT'S NEXT?**</u>**
>
> **You may:**
>
> 🔧 **Request Changes** - Ask for modifications to the reverse engineering analysis if required
> ✅ **Approve & Continue** - Approve analysis and proceed to **Requirements Analysis**
```

## Step 12: Wait for User Approval

- **MANDATORY**: Do not proceed until user explicitly approves
- **MANDATORY**: This approval gate is **unconditional** — it must fire regardless of how the analysis was completed (by agents, retries, manual recovery, or any combination). Never skip this gate.
- **MANDATORY**: Log user's response in audit.md with complete raw input
