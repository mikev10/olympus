## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

**Token Metrics: Accurate Input/Output Split and Model Tracking**

- **Fixed token split tracking** - Input and output tokens now tracked separately instead of being set to 0
  - Added `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` fields to `TokenBudget` interface
  - UserPromptSubmit hook now accumulates to `input_tokens` field
  - PostToolUse hook now accumulates to `output_tokens` field
  - Stop hook uses actual split values in FeedbackEntry
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing session states

- **Fixed model identifier tracking** - Real model ID captured instead of "unknown"
  - Added `current_model` field to session state
  - UserPromptSubmit hook captures model from `ctx.message.model`
  - Stop hook uses captured model ID in FeedbackEntry
  - Enables accurate per-model cost estimation

**Impact**: Cost estimates are now accurate and reflect actual input/output token usage per model. The learning system can now properly calculate model-specific pricing and track efficiency metrics.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

**Critical UX: /plan questions now visible immediately**

- **Fixed hidden questions in `/plan` command** - Questions from Prometheus are now displayed immediately instead of being trapped in agent subprocess
  - Updated `/plan` command to execute planning workflow directly in main conversation
  - Added explicit instruction: "Ask questions DIRECTLY to the user via normal message output"
  - Updated Prometheus agent to never use AskUserQuestion tool when delegated
  - Questions now appear as regular text output, ensuring immediate visibility

- **Added interactive workflow documentation** - Created `docs/interactive-workflows.md` explaining when to execute directly vs delegate to agents
  - Documents the pattern for interactive commands that require real-time user interaction
  - Provides implementation checklist for future command development
  - Prevents similar UX issues in other interactive workflows

**Impact**: Users no longer need to ask "are you done?" to see questions. Planning sessions now feel natural and responsive.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-01-27

### 🎉 Official Release: Olympus v3.0.0

**"Summon the gods of code"**

Olympus is a powerful multi-agent orchestration system for Claude Code, providing intelligent task delegation, smart model routing, and automated workflow management.

#### Core Features

- **20+ Specialized Agents** - Oracle (architecture), Prometheus (planning), Olympian (execution), Librarian (research), Frontend Engineer (UI/UX), and more
- **Smart Model Routing** - Automatic tier selection (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) based on task complexity to optimize cost and performance
- **Todo List Management** - Automatic task tracking with real-time progress updates
- **Background Execution** - Long-running operations (builds, tests, installations) run async with notifications
- **Continuation Enforcement** - Never stops until all tasks are complete
- **Slash Commands** - `/ultrawork`, `/plan`, `/analyze`, `/deepsearch`, `/ascent`, and more
- **Planning Workflow** - Prometheus for strategic planning, Momus for critical review, `/complete-plan` for verification

#### Slash Commands

- `/ultrawork` - Maximum performance mode with aggressive parallelization
- `/plan` - Start planning session with Prometheus
- `/review` - Critical plan evaluation with Momus
- `/analyze` - Deep analysis and investigation
- `/deepsearch` - Thorough codebase search
- `/ascent` - Self-referential loop until task completion
- `/complete-plan` - Verify and complete implemented plans

#### Installation

```bash
npm install -g olympus-ai
olympus-ai install
```

Or use the install script:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikev10/olympus/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

#### Getting Started

After installation, Olympus operates automatically as your default mode in Claude Code:
- Creates todos before non-trivial tasks
- Delegates complex work to specialized agents
- Runs independent tasks in parallel
- Continues until all tasks are complete

For complex projects, use `/plan` to create a strategic plan before implementation.

#### Self-Learning System

**New in v3.0.0:** Olympus now learns from your interactions and evolves over time.

**Features:**
- **Passive Feedback Capture** - Automatically detects corrections, preferences, and patterns from your interactions
- **Pattern Extraction** - Identifies recurring feedback using Jaccard similarity (minimum 3 occurrences)
- **Preference Learning** - Infers verbosity level (concise vs. detailed), autonomy preference (ask first vs. just do it), and style preferences
- **Agent Performance Tracking** - Monitors success/failure rates per agent with 30-day decay for outdated patterns
- **Discovery Storage** - Agents record technical insights about your codebase (gotchas, workarounds, patterns, dependencies)
- **Context Injection** - Learned preferences automatically applied in new sessions (~500 token limit to avoid context bloat)

**Storage Locations:**
- **Global:** `~/.claude/olympus/learning/`
- **Project:** `.olympus/learning/`

**Files:**
- `feedback-log.jsonl` - All feedback entries (append-only)
- `user-preferences.json` - Learned user preferences
- `agent-performance.json` - Per-agent performance metrics
- `discoveries.jsonl` - Technical insights (global & project-specific)
- `session-state.json` - Current session state
- `patterns.json` - Project-specific patterns

**How It Works:**
1. Session 1: You correct Claude → Olympus records feedback
2. Session 2-3: Pattern emerges (3+ similar corrections)
3. Session 4+: Preference auto-injected → Claude applies it proactively

The learning system operates silently in the background with zero configuration required.

## [2.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-01-13

### 🚀 Revolutionary: Intelligent Model Routing

**This is a major release introducing adaptive model routing for all agents.**

The orchestrator (Opus) now analyzes task complexity BEFORE delegation and routes to the appropriate model tier (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus). This dramatically improves efficiency - simple tasks use faster, cheaper models while complex tasks get the full power of Opus.

### Added
- **Intelligent Model Routing System** (`src/features/model-routing/`)
  - `types.ts`: Core types for routing (ComplexityTier, RoutingDecision, etc.)
  - `signals.ts`: Complexity signal extraction (lexical, structural, context)
  - `scorer.ts`: Weighted scoring system for complexity calculation
  - `rules.ts`: Priority-based routing rules engine
  - `router.ts`: Main routing logic with `getModelForTask()` API
  - `prompts/`: Tier-specific prompt adaptations (opus.ts, sonnet.ts, haiku.ts)

- **Adaptive Routing for ALL Agents**
  - Only orchestrators are fixed to Opus (they analyze and delegate)
  - All other agents adapt based on task complexity:
    - `oracle`: lookup → Haiku, tracing → Sonnet, debugging → Opus
    - `prometheus`: breakdown → Haiku, planning → Sonnet, strategic → Opus
    - `momus`: checklist → Haiku, gap analysis → Sonnet, adversarial → Opus
    - `metis`: impact → Haiku, deps → Sonnet, risk analysis → Opus
    - `explore`: simple search → Haiku, complex → Sonnet
    - `document-writer`: simple docs → Haiku, complex → Sonnet
    - `olympian`: simple fix → Haiku, module work → Sonnet, risky → Opus

- **Complexity Signal Detection**
  - Lexical: word count, keywords (architecture, debugging, risk, simple)
  - Structural: subtask count, cross-file deps, impact scope, reversibility
  - Context: previous failures, conversation depth, plan complexity

- **Tiered Prompt Adaptations**
  - Haiku: Concise, direct prompts for speed
  - Sonnet: Balanced prompts for efficiency
  - Opus: Deep reasoning prompts with thinking mode

### Changed
- **Orchestrator Prompts** updated with intelligent routing guidance
- **Configuration** (`src/config/loader.ts`) now includes routing options
- **Types** (`src/shared/types.ts`) extended with routing configuration

### Breaking Changes
- Routing is now proactive (orchestrator decides upfront) instead of reactive
- Deprecated `routeWithEscalation()` - use `getModelForTask()` instead

### Migration Guide
No action needed - the system automatically routes based on complexity. To override:
```typescript
Task(subagent_type="oracle", model="opus", prompt="Force Opus for this task")
```

## [1.11.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Enhanced Hook Enforcement System** - Stronger Olympus behavior enforcement beyond CLAUDE.md
  - `pre-tool-enforcer.sh`: PreToolUse hook that injects contextual Olympus reminders before every tool execution
  - `post-tool-verifier.sh`: PostToolUse hook for verification after tools, with failure detection
  - Enhanced `persistent-mode.sh`: Stop hook now includes build/test/git/background task verification
  - `claude-olympus.sh`: CLI wrapper that uses `--append-system-prompt` for direct system prompt injection
  - `olympus-aliases.sh`: Shell aliases (`claude-s`, `claudew`) for easy activation

### Changed
- **Stop Hook** now enforces additional verification requirements:
  - Build verification (if build scripts exist)
  - Test verification (if tests exist)
  - Git status check (warns on uncommitted changes)
  - Background task completion check
  - All previous checks (The Ascent, Ultrawork, Todo completion)

- **Hook Configuration** - Added PreToolUse and PostToolUse to `hooks.json`

### Technical Details
- PreToolUse hook provides tool-specific reminders (Bash, Task, Edit, Write, Read, Grep/Glob)
- PostToolUse hook tracks session statistics in `~/.claude/.session-stats.json`
- Stop hook returns `continue: false` until ALL verification requirements are met
- CLI wrapper appends core Olympus rules directly to Claude's system prompt

### Enforcement Hierarchy
1. **Stop Hook** with `continue: false` - Blocks ALL stopping until verified
2. **PreToolUse** - Injects reminders BEFORE every tool
3. **PostToolUse** - Verifies AFTER every tool
4. **CLI Wrapper** - Appends rules to system prompt
